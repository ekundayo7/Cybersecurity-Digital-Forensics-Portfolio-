# TryHackMe: Case #B4DM755 – Digital Forensics Challenge

##  Summary
Case #B4DM755 is a beginner-friendly forensic investigation room on TryHackMe where a user is tasked with uncovering evidence of malware and suspicious activity using FTK Imager.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- FTK Imager
- Windows Registry Viewer
- TryHackMe virtual machine
- Google Search (for hash and IOC verification)

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed
1. **Memory Image Acquisition**
   - Used FTK Imager to inspect a memory dump.
2. **Registry Inspection**
   - Explored user activity and startup entries.
3. **Suspicious Files**
   - Located malware samples via hash lookup.
5. **Persistence Check**
   - Identified files added to autorun locations.

## 🧠 Sample Questions Solved
- **What was the suspicious process?**  
  > `notepad++.exe` running from an unusual directory

- **What site hosted the malicious payload?**  
  > `evilwebsite.ru`

- **What was the hash of the payload?**  
  > `5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99`

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Digital Forensics process; pre and post authorisation.
- Process for establishing a chain od custody.
- Cybersecurity Frameworks using in digital forensics: Identify, protect, detect, response and recover.
- How to extract and interpret registry files
- Using exif tools to read all metadata of an image.
- Using FTK Imager to analyze RAM dumps
- Real world steps to identify malware infection points
- Importance of correlating hashes with malware databases (e.g VirusTotal)

- This project helped strengthen my skills in digital forensics, malware identification, and investigative procedures in Windows environments.
