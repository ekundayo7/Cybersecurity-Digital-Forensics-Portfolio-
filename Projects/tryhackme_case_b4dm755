TryHackMe: Case #B4DM755 â€“ Digital Forensics Challenge

SUMMARY:
Case #B4DM755 is a beginner-friendly forensic investigation room on TryHackMe where a user is tasked with uncovering evidence of malware and suspicious activity using FTK Imager.

TOOL USED 
- FTK Imager
- Windows Registry Viewer
- TryHackMe virtual machine
- Google Search (for hash and IOC verification)

KEY STEPS PERFORMED 
1. Memory Image Acquisition: Used FTK Imager to inspect a memory dump.
2. Registry Inspection: Explored user activity and startup entries.
3. File Recovery: Recovered deleted and encrypted files containing evidences.
5. Persistence Check: Identified files added to autorun locations.

WHAT I LEARNED 
- Digital Forensics process; pre and post authorisation.
- Process for establishing a chain od custody.
- Cybersecurity Frameworks using in digital forensics: Identify, protect, detect, response and recover.
- How to extract and interpret registry files
- Using exif tools to read all metadata of an image.
- Using FTK Imager to analyze RAM dumps
- Real world steps to identify malware infection points
- Importance of correlating hashes with malware databases (e.g VirusTotal)

- This project helped strengthen my skills in digital forensics, malware identification, and investigative procedures in Windows environments.
